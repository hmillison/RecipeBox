RecipeBox
=========

I created a Simple Recipe Manager to learn how to work with Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB.

Adding recipes to the users' collection is done by two ways, search and scraping.
Recipe search is supported by Yummly's API.
Scraping uses Cheerio.JS to grab the correct DOM elements to add to a recipe.
This only supports a few websites (foodnetwork, allrecipes)

Recipes can be added to the user's Grocery List and send to their email.

User's can create tags for easy, customizable organization of their collection.
